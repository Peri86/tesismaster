The program commfind impements the algorithms for the detection of
communities in complex networks described in the papers:
1) L. Donetti and Miguel A Muñoz,
   Detecting network communities: a new systematic and efficient algorithm,
    J. Stat. Mech.: Theor. Exp. (2004) P10012;
2) L. Donetti and Miguel A Muñoz,
   Improved spectral algorithm for the detection of network communities,
   physics/0504059;
with the choices of angular distance and complete linkage clustering.
The method described in 2) is the default one, while the other one is
used if the command line flag -L is used.

It takes two command line arguments: the name of the file that
describe the network topology, and the number of eigenvector to
compute. The input file must be a text file where each line contains
an (undirected) edge, that is the vertices it connects (see
exapmle.net). The network must be connected.

The output is the list of nodes (starting from index 0) with the index
denoting the community to which it has been assigned.
