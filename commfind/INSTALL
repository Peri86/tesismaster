In the unpacking directory just do:

   make

The program depends on the ARPACK library which, in turn, depends on
the LAPACK and BLAS libraries. If linking fails, find out the correct
names of shared libraries and their path, then edit the first lines of
the Makefile accordingly.

The executable will be called commfind and will be placed in the
current directory. It can be executed without any intallation.

The program has only been tested on the author's GNU/Linux system; it
should build and run on other systems, but it may require some
changes.
